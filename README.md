# FlipperMusicRTTTL
Selection of RTTTL .txt files that will work with the FIipperZero Music Player. 

~~Create a "music_player" folder on the root of the SD card, place files inside that folder.
Subdirectories are currently not supported on the latest build.~~

Create a folder under:
```
apps_data\music_player
```
Put any .fmf or .txt files here so you can see all the songs.
Thank you *@drshade.* for the info.

Make sure you are downloading the .txt file and not a .html for them to work.

Feel free to add or make any changes.

Adding a new folder called "ArcadeTones", it will contain newer additions.

When using RingtoneComposer make sure you are exporting as an RTTTL and not saving as a txt file.

SendTone is usuful for minor edits and is very similar to nokring.

Nokring is best for composing from scratch, also good for edits.
